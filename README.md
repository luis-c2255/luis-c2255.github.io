### Data Analyst | Process Optimizer | Customer Service Specialist

I transform complex datasets into actionable business stories. With a decade of experience in customer operations and a suite of professional certifications in Data Science and Automation, I bridge the gap between technical analysis and human-centric solutions.

## About Me

For over 10 years, I thrived in the fast-paced world of customer service at global brands like H&M and Guess. While I loved solving immediate problems for people, I became fascinated by the "why" behind the patterns I saw. 

In 2025, I took a leave of absence to immerse myself in personal growth, and expand horizons. And I didn't just learn one tool; I mastered the entire ecosystem - from Python automation and SQL databases to Machine Learning and UX Design. My goal is to use data not just to find numbers, but to find the stories that help businesses grow and serve their customers better. 

My transition into Data Science wasn't a sudden shift, but an evolution. While working as a Customer Service Specialist at H&M, I realized that efficiency starts with clear data. I took the initiative to design a workload template that allowed my team to visualize the tasks, enabling better prioritization and more balanced operations. 

I also recognized a gap in how we handled technical escalations. To bridge it, I authored a comprehensive IT User Guide, creating step-by-step protocols for resolving the most common issues. These experiences - balancing user needs with system logic - drove me to formalize my skills through Google and IBM professional certifications in Data Science, Python, and UX Design.
